<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Prajwol Parajuli, and I was born on May 1, 2003, in the vibrant city of Butwal, Nepal. From a young age, I've been curious about how things work—especially technology. This interest naturally led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering, where I’ve been able to sharpen my skills and explore various aspects of the digital world.</p>

<p>My primary goal is to become a skilled web developer. I am passionate about creating user-friendly websites and web applications that not only look great but function smoothly. I enjoy problem-solving and constantly look for ways to improve my coding abilities through projects, learning new frameworks, and staying updated with current trends in web development.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I thrive on adventure. I love activities that bring a rush of adrenaline—like bungee jumping, swimming, and bike riding. These hobbies keep me energized, push my limits, and teach me to stay calm under pressure—qualities I also bring to my work in tech. I'm always eager to take on new challenges, both in life and in my career.</p>
